								<h3>Biography</h3>
								<p>Michael E. McHenry is a Prof. Materials Sci. and Eng. (MSE), with appointments in Physics, Mechanical and Biomedical Eng. at Carnegie Mellon. 
								He graduated with a B.S. in Metallurgical Eng. and Materials Science from Case Western Reserve in 1980.  From 1980 to 1983 he was employed as Process Engineer at U.S. Steel Lorain Works. 
								He earned a 1988 Ph.D in Materials Science and Eng. from MIT and was a 1988-89 Director's Funded Post-doctoral Fellow at Los Alamos Lab.  
								He has expertise in soft magnetic nanocomposites, and materials for power conversion, biomedical, energy and data storage applications. </p>
								<p>Prof. McHenry's research involves rapid solidification processing, plasma and solution synthesis of nanoparticles, magnetic field and strain processing of materials, x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and magnetic properties characterization. He directed a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) on high temperature magnetic materials for aircraft power applications and led an ARPA-E program in magnetic materials for power electronics.
								He was Technical Evaluator for a NATO AVT-231 Specialists Meeting on "Scarcity of Rare Earth Materials for Electrical Power Systems", Brussels, Belgium,  (2014) and continues considering implications Rare Earth Element scarcity for NATO countries. He has served as proceeding Editor, Publication Chair and member of the Program Committee for the Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (MMM) and Intermag Conferences. He has published over 350 papers and owns many patents in the field.
								He co-authored the textbook “Structure of Materials”, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2007 (2nd edition in 2012). 
								He was a recipient of a 2019 Carnegie Science Center and R&D 100 awards.</p>

								<h3>Biography</h3>
								<p>Maarten P. de Boer is a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and at at Carnegie Mellon University.
								After completing his PhD. in materials science at the University of Minnesota in 1996, he spent 13 years at Sandia National Labs in the MEMS technology department.
								He is currently a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
								He has published 65 journal articles, 34 conference articles, five book chapters, has received seven patents, and has presented more than 30 invited talks. 
								Three graduate students have completed their Ph.D. under his supervision at Carnegie Mellon, and he is currently supporting six Ph.D. students. 
						         At Carnegie Mellon, de Boer has received funding from NSF, Sandia National Labs, and industry partners. He organized symposia in 1999, 2000, 2010 and 2011 for the Materials Research Society conference, and edited a section of the 2012 Springer Verlag Encyclopedia of Nanotechnology on micro- and nanodevices.</p>
								<p>Maarten de Boer’s research interests are in the area of nano- and micromechanics, with an emphasis on enhancing reliability of small-scale, micro-, and nanoelectromechanical systems (N/MEMS) devices, and on investigating the mechanical properties of new materials. 
								The major research theme in the de Boer group is materials testing through high throughput micro- and nanofabricated test instruments. 
								The work involves design, modeling, micro/nanofabrication, testing, and analysis. 
								In one research area, detailed models of capillary and van der Waals adhesion mechanisms are synthesized.
								In another, microactuators are employed to test mechanical properties including friction, strength, and electrical resistance. Materials of interest include ceramics, polymers, and metals.</p>
