								<h2>AMPED Consortium Receives NSF IUCRC Planning Grant</h2><!-- -->
								<h4>February 8, 2022</h4>
														
								<p> The Advanced Magnetics for Power and Energy Development (AMPED) Consortium has received a $60,000 planning grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its prestigious Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers Program (IUCRC).<p>
								The AMPED Consortium aims to address the growing need for improved soft magnetic materials and enhanced device applications that can operate in emerging electric power conversion and energy technologies. The award will be evenly split between the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University.<p>

								<h2>Pitt Energy GRID Institute Partners with Duquesne Light Co. to Modernize Electric Grid and the Workforce that Maintains It</h2><!-- -->
								<h4>January 4, 2022</h4>
														
								<p> To keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology of electric power systems, the University of Pittsburgh Energy GRID Institute and Duquesne Light Co. (DLC) are partnering to create a collaborative platform that will advance and implement innovative solutions in support of a more secure, resilient, and clean energy grid.<p>
								The current electricity delivery network has been primarily designed to flow in one direction, from bulk generation to distribution through several substations at varying voltage levels. As electric power systems evolve to include distributed energy resources, the mass-market adoption of electric vehicles, and broader customer engagement in generation utilization, new challenges continue to emerge – both technically and with workforce development. <p>
								This partnership will spur increased innovation, research, and create economic and workforce development opportunities for students, faculty, and engineers to build a smart, connected city. <p>

								<h2>AMPED Holds Successful First Meeting</h2><!-- -->
								<h4>October 26, 2022</h4>
														
								<p>On October 7th, the Advanced Magnetics for Power and Energy Development (AMPED) held its inaugural consortium meeting both remotely and in person at the Pittsburgh Energy Innovation Center.<p>
								The event had 75 attendees, comprised of 25 members from universities and 50 from industry representing 35 unique companies. Lynn Peterson from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Andre Pereira from the Department of Energy (DOE) were the keynote speakers. The schedule also included a student poster session and time for networking with other attendees.<p>
								Led by Director Prof. Paul Ohodnicki (MEMS) and Co-Director Prof. Brandon Grainger (ECE) at the University of Pittsburgh, the AMPED Consortium was formed in 2020 with the mission to develop an innovation ecosystem and educational programs for advancing soft magnetic materials and component technologies spanning fundamental science to end-use application in collaboration with various agencies, offices, and programs. <p>

								<h2>DESIGNING A MORE SUSTAINABLE ELECTRIC VEHICLE</h2><!-- -->
								<h4>August 12,2021</h4>
						

								
								<p> Most electric motors for electric vehicles rely on permanent magnets made with rare-earth metals. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Swanson School of Engineering are working with Powdermet Inc., a nanomaterials and advanced materials research and development company in Euclid, Ohio, to develop a rare-earth mineral free electric engine.
								The project recently received $200,000 in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).<p>
