								<h3>Pitt ENERGY Grid Institute</h3>
								<p>The University of Pittsburgh’s Energy GRID Institute, newly established to leverage public and private partnerships with state-of-the-art laboratories and facilities, is a comprehensive international solution center for the entire electric power industry, located in downtown Pittsburgh at the Energy Innovation Center. 
								The laboratory was nationally benchmarked to create academia's most advanced electric power utility scale research entity. The lab focuses on advancing modern power systems, 
								integrating distributed generation sources into AC (13.8 kV, 4.16 kV, 480 V, 208 V) 
								and DC (1.5 kV, 380 V) microgrids in order to demonstrate and study novel power products, as well as monitoring, control and protection systems.</p>

												<h3>Pitt Center for Energy</h3>
								<p>The University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Energy is a university-wide endeavor that leverages the energy-related expertise of approximately 100 faculty members across campus from multiple 
								disciplines and departments among the Swanson School of Engineering, Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, Law School, Business School and the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs.  
                             Established in 2008, the Center is a unifying entity for faculty members to collaborate with each other, regional energy industry leaders, government agencies, and the community to address the many challenges and opportunities
                              associated with the generation, transmission, and utilization of energy.</p>

								<h3>CMU Scott Institute for Energy</h3>
								<p>The Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation is a university-wide research initiative at CMU focused on improving energy efficiency and developing new, clean, affordable and sustainable energy sources. The institute was created through a lead gift from CMU alumni Sherman Scott, president and founder of Delmar Systems, and his wife Joyce Bowie Scott. The institute is named after Sherman Scott’s father, Wilton, and is located in Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall, on CMU’s Pittsburgh campus.
                                   Using Carnegie Mellon’s expertise in integrated systems, problem-solving, and an understanding of the intersection of energy and public policy, the work of the institute concentrates on energy efficiencies and reliability, as well as smart operations, materials and processes.</p>

												<h3>NCSU, FREEDM Center</h3>
								<p>The modern human depends on an ever-updating array of electronic devices: smartphones, smart televisions, smart thermostats, computers, even electric cars.
                                      Yet the American electric grid that powers those devices has gone largely unchanged for decades. It still runs largely on sources that harm the environment and compromise national security. It still exposes consumers everywhere to outages anywhere and still has little capacity for tapping renewable energy sources.
                                 In 2008, the National Science Foundation chose NC State to lead an effort to create a modern power grid. At the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) Systems Engineering Research Center, universities from the United States have joined forces with industry partners to develop a more secure, sustainable environmentally friendly electric grid.
                                 At the FREEDM Center, we’re building the internet of energy: a network of distributed energy resources that intelligently manages power using secure communications and advanced power electronics. Our research priorities include power electronics packaging, controls theory, solid state transformers, fault isolation devices, and power systems simulation and demonstration.

															<h3>NCSU, Power America Center</h3>
								<p>The PowerAmerica Institute at N.C. State University was founded in 2015 and is one of 14 Manufacturing US Institutes nationwide. Each institute is narrowly focused on growing a sector of advanced manufacturing, thus making the U.S. better poised to complete economically on a global scale. PowerAmerica is backed by $70 million in funding from the Department of energy, with matching funds from industry partners and the State of North Carolina.
                                  Our mission is to save energy and create U.S. manufacturing jobs by accelerating the development and large-scale adoption of wide bandgap semiconductor technology made with silicon carbide and gallium nitride in power electronics systems.</p>
