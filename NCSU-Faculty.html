								<h3>Biography</h3>
								<p>Subhashish Bhattacharya received the B.E. degree from IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India, the M.E. degree from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA, in 2003, all in electrical engineering. He worked in the FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) and Power Quality group at Westinghouse R&D Center in Pittsburgh, which later became part of Siemens Power Transmission & Distribution, from 1998 to 2005. He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in August 2005, where he is the Duke Energy Distinguished Professor and a founding faculty member of NSF ERC FREEDM Systems Center, Advanced Transportation Energy Center [ATEC] and the US DOE initiative on WBG based Manufacturing Innovation Institute â€“ PowerAmerica - at NCSU. A part of his Ph.D. research on active power filters was commercialized by York Corporation Inc. [now part of Johnson Controls] for air- conditioner chiller products. </p>
								<p>His research interests are Solid-State Transformers, Integration of renewable energy resources, MV power converters enabled by HV SiC devices, FACTS, Utility applications of power electronics and power quality issues; DC Microgrids, high-frequency magnetics, active filters, and application of new power semiconductor devices such as SiC and GaN for converter topologies. His research is funded by several industries, NSF, DoE, ARPA-E, US Navy, ONR, NASA. He has over 500 publications and 10 patents with several pending patent applications.</p>

								<h3>Biography</h3>
								<p>Richard Byron Beddingfield was born in Atlanta, GA in 1990. He started research work with Dr. Subhashish Bhattacharya at North Carolina State University as an Undergraduate Research Scholar in 2012.
								He focused on active filters after completing a three semester CO-OP rotation with Nucor Steel Hertford, NC where he fell in love with high power, high voltage converters after seeing the capabilities of the DC and AC electric arc furnaces. He completed a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, Magna Cum Laude, and the University Honors Program from North Carolina State University in 2013. He then completed his Professional Science Masters in Electric Power Systems Engineering with a Renewable Electric Energy Systems Certificate in 2014. During his PhD work, he visited Carnegie Mellon and the US Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory as an ORISE Postgraduate Fellow. There he gained an appreciation and passion for magnetic materials and components. He completed his PhD research in magnetic materials and components for high power, medium frequency power converters in the summer of 2018. His current research interests are to leverage the intersection of material science and electrical engineering to improve magnetic component designs to meet the challenging demands of modern wide bandgap power electronics converters.</p>
